## You are inspecting a UART signal.To be able to read the UART data, the device reading it must know the speed of the incoming signal in terms of a value called Baud rate (bits per second). Many industry standard devices set common baud rates like 9600 and 115200 but on applying the same settings for your signal, you do not get an error free reading. Explain what you would do in this situation to correctly identify the custom baud rate of the signal and read the data, given that you have the needed software to inspect several factors of the signal such as timing(pulse width) and voltage levels.
