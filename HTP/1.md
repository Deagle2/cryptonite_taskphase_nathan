### A device you are inspecting works with 5v logic levels. You need to measure the pulse width of one of the output signals, but the microcontroller you are handed works on 3.3v logic levels.
### What resistor combination do you use do extract 3.3v out of 5v. (Resistor combination and resistor to tap voltage out off).
