### A device you are inspecting works with 5v logic levels. You need to measure the pulse width of one of the output signals, but the microcontroller you are handed works on 3.3v logic levels.
### What resistor combination do you use do extract 3.3v out of 5v. (Resistor combination and resistor to tap voltage out off).

To solve this problem we use a voltage divider formula that is:
Vout/Vin = R2/R1+R2

Where:
- Vin= 5 V
- R1 = 0.5kΩ
- R2 = 1kΩ 

We have to find out R1 and R2 values so that Vout/Vin = 3.3/5 = 0.66
R2/(R1+R2) = 1/(0.5+1) = 0.66

The correct resistor combination to extract 3.3V from a 5V source is **0.5kΩ and 1kΩ**, with the tap point at the **1kΩ resistor**.
Tap out is where the voltage is divided, i.e, R2 = 1kΩ
