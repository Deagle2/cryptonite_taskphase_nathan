### This is the schematic of the device you are trying to attack via a method called Side Channel analysis. You connect a resistor across the 3.3v supply and 3V3 input of the MCU and measure the voltage across the resistor to see changes in the current. To be able to identify its different operations in greater detail, you must be able to record more noise(measure more sensitivity) in the signal. What changes can you make to the circuit to do so?
