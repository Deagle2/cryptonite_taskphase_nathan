### A purely electronic passcode checker (Passcode is purely binary), checks a passcode of 32 bits. To pass-on the passcode to the checking device a 32 bit SIPO shift register(might want to quickly look up how shift registers work) is used where each bit must be sent in one at a time, but all 32 bits are available at once at the output. 
### By simple math we can understand that we would need to shift 32*(2^32) bits to test out all combinations. To speed up this process, the concept of  de bruijn sequences are introduced.

### How many bits would we need to shift to test out all 2^32 combinations in the de bruijn form?
