### The given microcontroller is adjusted to work at a clock speed of 72 MHz. You need to use the input capture of this microcontroller to measure the pulse width given to it with a resolution of 0.25 micro second. After how many clock pulses do you increment the time counter by 1 to achieve this (a)? It is also observed that the pulse width varies from 64 micro seconds to 128 microseconds. 
### The time counter resets after reaching a certain value. What should be the minimum value of the counter at which it resets to cover the range (b in hex)? (a, b)
