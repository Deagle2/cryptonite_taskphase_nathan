# Module 2: Pondering Paths

## Course Introduction
The Linux filesystem is a "tree". That is, it has a root (written as /). The root of the filesystem is a directory, and every directory can contain other directories and files. You refer to files and directories by their path. A path from the root of the filesystem starts with / (that is, the root of the filesystem), and describes the set of directories that must be descended into to find the file. Every piece of the path is demarcated with another /
  

   ## The Root

     ## Program and Absolute Paths
- **Description**: 
  The > character is used to redirect the output from a command to a file. In this case, we 
  will redirect the output of the echo command to a file.

     ## Position thy self
- **Description**: 
  The > character is used to redirect the output from a command to a file. In this case, we 
  will redirect the output of the echo command to a file.

     ## Position elsewhere
- **Description**: 
  The > character is used to redirect the output from a command to a file. In this case, we

  The > character is used to redirect the output from a command to a file. In this case, we 
  will redirect the output of the echo command to a file.

- **To obtain the flag**:

     ## implicit relative paths, from/
- **Description**: 
  The > character is used to redirect the output from a command to a file. In this case, we

     ## explicit relative paths, from/ 
- **Description**: 
  The > character is used to redirect the output from a command to a file. In this case, we
