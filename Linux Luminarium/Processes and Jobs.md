# Module 7: Processes and Jobs

## Course Introduction

> Operating system kernels: A kernel is the essential foundation of a computer's operating system (OS). It's the core that provides basic services for all other parts of the OS

>  When Linux starts up, it launches an init (short for initializer) process that, in turn, launches a bunch of other processes which launch more processes until, eventually, you are looking at your command line shell, which is also a process


# Listing Processes
`ps` either stands for "process snapshot" or "process status", and it lists processes. By default, ps just lists the processes running in your terminal
ps aux and ps -ef 
- **To obtain the flag**:
  
>  1. ls /challenge gives permission denied
>  2. ps -ef , a quick run through the processes gives us a process related to the /challenge/run, for me it was /challenge/8584-run-5314
>  3. /challenge/8584-run-5314 to obtain flag

# Killing Processes

`kill` will terminate a process in a way that gives it a chance to get its affairs in order before ceasing to exist.
