# Module 9: Perceiving Permissions

# Changing File Ownership
 Intro to chown command, to change the file ownership

 Usage: `chown [username] [file]`

- **To obtain the flag**:

  
  1. ls -l /flag
  2. chown hacker /flag
  3. ls -l /flag
  4. cat /flag
---

# Groups and Files
`id` command
The `chgrp` command in Linux is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory. All files in Linux belong to an owner and a group. 

- **To obtain the flag**:

  1. id
  2. ls -l /flag
  3. chgrp hacker /flag
  4. cat /flag

---

# Fun with Groups Names

- **To obtain the flag**:

  1.id
   ```
   uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp3960) groups=1000(grp3960)
 2. chgrp grp3960 /flag
 3. ls -l /flag
 4. cat /flag

---

# Changing Permissions
Intro to `chmod` (change mode) command

Usage `chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE`
eg:-

- **To obtain the flag**:

  1. chmod u+r /flag
  2. cat /flag

---

# Executable Files

- **To obtain the flag**:

  1. chmod +x /challenge/run
  2. /challenge/run

---

# Permission Tweaking Practice

- **To obtain the flag**:
- This was a particularly tricky and painstaking task, so I used some help, after 3-4 rounds the challenge becomes simpler

of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

# The SUID Bit

"Set User ID" (SUID) permissions bit allows the user to run a program as the owner of that program's file. This means that, regardless of what user runs the program (as long as they have executable permissions), the program will execute as the owner user 
Usage `chmod u+s [program]`

- **To obtain the flag**:

  1.  chmod u+s /challenge/getroot

  2.  /challenge/getroot

> SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root! Here is your shell...

    3.  cat /flag
