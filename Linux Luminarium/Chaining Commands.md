# Module 11: Chaining Commands

## Course Introduction


# Chaining with semicolons
To chain /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college

- **To obtain the flag**:
  1. /challenge/pwn  ; /challenge/college
---

# Your First Shell Script
Run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, but this time in a shell script called x.sh

- **To obtain the flag**:
  1. Make a new text file x.sh, my directory was /home/hacker/x.sh
  2. /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college cmds in file
  3. `bash x.sh` in terminal

---

# Redirecting Script Output
In this level, we will practice piping (|) from your script to another program. Like before, you need to create a script that calls the /challenge/pwn command followed by the /challenge/college command, and pipe the output of the script into a single invocation of the /challenge/solve command

- **To obtain the flag**:
  1. Make a new text file, I made my_script.sh, put the commands /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college
  2. ` chmod +x my_script.sh `, to make your script executable.
  3. Pipe the output ` ./my_script.sh | /challenge/solve `

# Executable Shell Scripts
Make a shellscript that will invoke /challenge/solve, make it executable, and run it without explicitly invoking bash

- **To obtain the flag**:
  1. As the challenge wasn't that clear, using external help we understand the use of #!/bin/bash
  2. The #!/bin/bash at the top tells the system to use bash to interpret the script.
  3. Make a new text file x.sh and type
      #!/bin/bash
      /challenge/solve
  4. In the terminal, `chmod +x x.sh` 
  5. `./x.sh `
